  - Hello, my name is Mr.Mallow.
  - I am the mayor of Candyland.
  - There have been a lot of children in dreamworld lately, tearing everything apart.
  - Now a girl called Maya is running around in Candyland eating all of the candy.
  - The citizens of Candyland are scared and won't leave their homes, until Maya
    is woken up
  - We used to have an alarm clock to wake up children visiting this place, but it
    broke and the pieces got lost.
  - I am trying to gather food for the citizens of Candyland, but i'm scared to leave
    the city, as Maya might be out there
  - Could you find us some candy? There should be plenty out there as we haven't
    been able to collect them for days.
  - When you find candy press "E" to pick it up.
  - Ah thank you so much this should be enough to feed the people of candyland.
  - now to deal with Maya you should look for parts of the alarm to wake her up.
  - They say that parts have been seen in the Marshmallow maze, the chocolate castle,
    lollypop island and the cotton candy forest.
